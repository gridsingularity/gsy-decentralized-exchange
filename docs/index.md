# Decentralized Energy Exchange Reference Architecture

## Introduction

The Decentralized Energy Exchange (DEX) system aims to revolutionize the way energy is traded and managed by leveraging the power of distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain, and advanced distributed runtime functionalities. 

This document presents a reference architecture for the DEX system, which serves as a blueprint for designing, developing, and implementing a robust, secure, and efficient platform for energy trading in a decentralized environment.

The reference architecture is intended for developers, architects, stakeholders, and decision-makers involved in the DEX system. 

It outlines the key components, interactions, and design principles that guide the development and implementation of the system, ensuring its scalability, modularity, and interoperability while maintaining high security and data privacy standards. 

By following this reference architecture, the DEX system can effectively facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading, optimize energy consumption and generation, and ultimately contribute to a more sustainable and resilient energy infrastructure.

## Design Principles

The Decentralized Energy Exchange system is designed around a set of key principles that guide its development and ensure that it meets the requirements of a modern, efficient, and secure energy trading platform. These design principles are aligned with the use of the Substrate framework for the development of the distributed ledger combined with the definition of a set of complementary ancillary services.

1. **Modularity**: The architecture is built on a modular structure, enabling each component to be developed, tested, and maintained independently. This modularity simplifies the development process and allows for easy integration of new features, modules, or services in the future.

2. **Scalability**: The system is designed to scale horizontally, accommodating the growing number of participants, transactions, and data within the Decentralized Energy Exchange. The use of Substrate allows for a highly scalable and efficient distributed ledger, while the ancillary services can also scale independently to handle increased loads.

3. **Interoperability**: The architecture promotes the use of open standards, protocols, and APIs to facilitate seamless integration with other systems, platforms, and technologies in the energy sector. This approach enables the Decentralized Energy Exchange to easily interact with other energy management systems, IoT devices, and existing infrastructure.

4. **Security**: Ensuring the security and integrity of the system is a top priority. The Substrate framework provides robust security features, including strong cryptographic algorithms and a proven consensus mechanism. In addition, the ancillary services and communication protocols must be designed with security best practices in mind, including encryption, access control, and secure data storage.

5. **Decentralization**: The Decentralized Energy Exchange leverages the power of blockchain technology to enable a fully decentralized system. This approach eliminates the need for a central authority, ensuring a transparent, secure, and efficient energy trading platform that is less susceptible to manipulation or control by any single entity.

6. **Flexibility**: The architecture is designed to be adaptable and capable of incorporating new technologies, innovations, and evolving market requirements. This flexibility is achieved through the use of modular components, extensible APIs, and a development process that encourages innovation and experimentation.

7. **Usability**: The user experience is an essential aspect of the Decentralized Energy Exchange. The system should be easy to use and accessible to a wide range of users, including energy producers, consumers, grid operators, and regulators. The user interfaces and APIs should be designed with simplicity, efficiency, and intuitiveness in mind.

By following these design principles, the Decentralized Energy Exchange system can effectively support the growing needs of the energy trading ecosystem and provide a secure, efficient, and transparent platform for peer-to-peer energy transactions.

## System Components

The Decentralized Energy Exchange system architecture is composed of several components that work together to provide a secure, scalable, and efficient platform for energy trading. The core of the system is built using the Substrate framework, which provides the distributed ledger and custom runtime for implementing the state transition functions required for the energy exchange. Additionally, the system includes a set of ancillary services that enable further scalability and security.

### Substrate-based Node

The Substrate-based node is the backbone of the Decentralized Energy Exchange system, consisting of two main parts:

1. **Client with outer node services**: This component handles network activities such as peer discovery, managing transaction requests, reaching consensus with peers, and responding to RPC calls.

2. **Custom Runtime**: This component contains all the business logic for executing the state transition functions of the blockchain. The custom runtime is designed to improve system security, scalability, and reduce attack surfaces, as opposed to using smart contracts on a generalized virtual machine.

Please to fine more info about the node in the [Node Section](./node/node.md).

### Ancillary Services

The Decentralized Energy Exchange system is also complemented by a set of ancillary services that provide additional functionality and improve system performance:

1. **Orderbook Service**: This service receives orders from the Substrate off-chain worker, which propagates the orders from the distributed ledger to an external data storage (MongoDB Cluster). The Orderbook Service manages the storage and retrieval of orders.

2. **Matching Engine**: The Matching Engine is responsible for fetching open orders from the external data storage and creating bid and offer matches using a two-sided pay-as-bid matching algorithm for the implemented continuous double auction.

3. **MongoDB Cluster**: The MongoDB cluster serves as the external data storage for the Orderbook Service and Matching Engine, providing a scalable and reliable solution for storing and retrieving order data.

4. **Node Gateway**: The Node Gateway acts as a bridge between external clients and the blockchain nodes, enabling secure and efficient communication and interaction with the Decentralized Energy Exchange system.

By combining the power of the Substrate framework with these ancillary services, the Decentralized Energy Exchange system offers a comprehensive solution for a modern, secure, and efficient energy trading platform.
